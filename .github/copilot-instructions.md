# Copilot Instructions for js-project-weather-app

## Project Overview
This is a JavaScript-based weather app. The repository currently contains minimal documentation and no source code files, so the architecture and workflows are not yet established. As the project evolves, update this file to reflect new conventions and patterns.

## Key Guidelines for AI Agents
- **Directory Structure**: Source code, configuration, and assets should be organized in clear, purpose-driven folders (e.g., `src/`, `public/`, `config/`).
- **Documentation**: Keep `README.md` up to date with setup, usage, and workflow instructions. Reference this file for project-specific conventions.
- **External Dependencies**: Document all dependencies in a manifest file (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js projects) and provide installation instructions.
- **Build & Run**: Specify build and run commands in the README or a dedicated section. Use scripts for common tasks (e.g., `npm start`, `npm test`).
- **Testing**: If tests are added, place them in a `tests/` or `__tests__/` directory and document the test runner and conventions.
- **Configuration**: Store environment-specific settings in `.env` files or a `config/` directory. Document required variables and their usage.
- **Patterns & Conventions**: As code is added, document any custom patterns, naming conventions, or architectural decisions here.

## Example Section (Update as Codebase Grows)
- If using React, place components in `src/components/` and use functional components by default.
- If using Express, place route handlers in `src/routes/` and middleware in `src/middleware/`.

## How to Update This File
- When new workflows, patterns, or conventions are introduced, add concise, actionable notes here.
- Reference specific files or directories that exemplify important practices.
- Remove outdated instructions as the project evolves.
