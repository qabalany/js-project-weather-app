## Introduction

Hey there! üëã This guide will help you understand how our weather app works. Imagine you're building a LEGO set - we'll look at each piece, understand what it does, and see how they all fit together to create something amazing!

Our weather app can:
- Show weather for Swedish cities üè∞
- Tell you today's temperature and forecast üå°Ô∏è
- Show weather for the next few days ‚è≥
- Let you use your location to get local weather üìç
- Show you when the sun rises and sets ‚òÄÔ∏è

## Basic Building Blocks

### 1. Types and Cities
```typescript
type City = { name: string; lat: number; lon: number };
const cities: City[] = [
  { name: 'Stockholm', lat: 59.3293, lon: 18.0686 },
  { name: 'Malm√∂', lat: 55.605, lon: 13.0038 },
  { name: 'Gothenburg', lat: 57.7089, lon: 11.9746 }
];
```
Think of a `City` as a special label that says "anything with this label must have a name and location (latitude and longitude)". It's like a form that must be filled out with:
- A name (like "Stockholm")
- A latitude number (like 59.3293)
- A longitude number (like 18.0686)

We create an array (list) of cities, each following this pattern. This helps TypeScript make sure we don't accidentally put wrong information in our cities!

### 2. Weather Icons and Descriptions
```typescript
const weatherIcons: { [key: number]: string } = {
  1: 'icons/day/01.svg',
  2: 'icons/day/02.svg',
  // ... more icons
};

const weatherText: { [key: number]: string } = {
  1: 'Clear',
  2: 'Nearly clear',
  // ... more descriptions
};
```
These are like translation dictionaries:
- `weatherIcons`: Converts weather codes (numbers) into picture files
- `weatherText`: Converts those same numbers into words we can read

For example:
- If the weather code is 1:
  - `weatherIcons[1]` gives us a sunny icon (`01.svg`)
  - `weatherText[1]` tells us it's "Clear"

### 3. Helper Functions
```typescript
function qs<T extends HTMLElement>(sel: string) {
  return document.querySelector(sel) as T | null;
}

function mapSymbolToIcon(sym: number) {
  return weatherIcons[sym] || 'icons/day/01.svg';
}
```
These are our tools that make common tasks easier:
- `qs`: Finds elements on our webpage (like finding a specific LEGO piece in a big box)
- `mapSymbolToIcon`: Gets the right weather icon (if it can't find one, it uses a default sunny icon)

## Working with Weather APIs

### 1. The SMHI Weather API
```typescript
const SMHI_POINT = (lat: number, lon: number) =>
  `https://opendata-download-metfcst.smhi.se/api/category/pmp3g/version/2/geotype/point/lon/${lon}/lat/${lat}/data.json`;
```
This creates the web address where we get our weather data. It's like knowing exactly which shelf in a library has the book you want! We just need to tell it where we are (latitude and longitude).

### 2. Fetching Weather Data
```typescript
async function fetchPointData(lat: number, lon: number) {
  const url = SMHI_POINT(lat, lon);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Fetch error ' + res.status);
  return res.json();
}
```
This function:
1. Takes a location (lat/lon)
2. Asks SMHI's servers for weather data
3. Waits for the answer (`await`)
4. Converts the answer from computer-language to JavaScript objects

It's like sending a letter to SMHI saying "What's the weather at these coordinates?" and waiting for their reply!

### 3. Organizing Weather Data
```typescript
function groupByDate(timeSeries: any[]) {
  const days: { [date: string]: any[] } = {};
  timeSeries.forEach(entry => {
    const date = entry.validTime.split('T')[0];
    if (!days[date]) days[date] = [];
    days[date].push(entry);
  });
  return days;
}
```
This function organizes weather data by date. Imagine having a stack of weather reports and sorting them into different folders, one for each day!

## Making the Page Come Alive

### 1. Rendering a City's Weather
```typescript
async function renderCity(city: City) {
  try {
    const data = await fetchPointData(city.lat, city.lon);
    const series = data.timeSeries as any[];
    // ... more code
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('renderCity error', err);
  }
}
```
This is our main function that:
1. Gets weather data for a city
2. Updates all the parts of our webpage with new information
3. Handles any errors that might happen

It's like a conductor in an orchestra, making sure every part plays its role perfectly!

### 2. Showing Current Weather
```typescript
const current = series[0];
const t = current.parameters.find((p: any) => p.name === 't')?.values[0];
const sym = current.parameters.find((p: any) => p.name === 'Wsymb2')?.values[0];
```
This part:
- Gets the current temperature (`t`)
- Gets the weather symbol (`Wsymb2`)
- Updates the big display at the top of our page

### 3. Creating Weather Cards
```typescript
dates.forEach((date, idx) => {
  // ... card creation code
  card.innerHTML = `
    <p class="weak-day">${dayName}</p>
    <div class="weak-two">
      <span class="weak-icon"><img src="${mapSymbolToIcon(sym)}" alt="${weatherText[sym] || ''}" width="28"/></span>
      <p class="weak-weather-info">${weatherText[sym] || String(sym)}</p>
    </div>
    <p class="weak-degree">${Math.round(min)}¬∞ / ${Math.round(max)}¬∞</p>
  `;
});
```
For each day, we create a card showing:
- The day name
- A weather icon
- A description of the weather
- The highest and lowest temperatures

## Advanced Features

### 1. Sunrise and Sunset Times
```typescript
const srUrl = `https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=${city.lat}&lng=${city.lon}&formatted=0`;
```
We use a different API to get sunrise and sunset times. This shows when the sun will rise and set in your city!

### 2. Geolocation
```typescript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos) => {
  const lat = pos.coords.latitude;
  const lon = pos.coords.longitude;
  const userCity = { name: 'Your location', lat, lon };
  renderCity(userCity);
});
```
When you click the map icon:
1. Asks your browser "Where am I?"
2. Browser asks your permission
3. If you agree, gets your location
4. Shows weather for where you are!

## Putting it All Together

Our app works like this:
1. When you open it:
   - Shows Stockholm's weather by default
   - Gets sunrise/sunset times
   - Shows today's forecast by hours
   - Shows next 4 days' forecast

2. When you search or use geolocation:
   - Gets new weather data
   - Updates all the displays
   - Shows new sunrise/sunset times

3. For each weather update:
   - Converts weather codes to icons and text
   - Shows temperatures and conditions
   - Updates all the cards and details

### Cool Technical Details ü§ì

1. **Error Handling**: We use `try/catch` blocks to handle problems gracefully - if something goes wrong, the app won't crash!

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript helps us avoid mistakes by checking our data types - it's like having a helpful friend looking over our shoulder saying "Are you sure about that?"

3. **Smart Defaults**: If something's missing (like a weather icon), we have backup plans (default sunny icon)!

4. **Clean Code**: Our functions each do one specific job and do it well - like having specialized tools instead of one complicated multi-tool.

## Want to Learn More? üéì

Try these exercises:
1. Look at the SMHI API documentation to see what other weather data we could show
2. Try adding more cities to the `cities` array
3. Experiment with different time formats for sunrise/sunset
4. Add more weather parameters to the details section

Remember: The best way to learn is to experiment! Try changing things and see what happens - just keep a backup of the working code first! üòâ

## Final Tips üí°

1. Always check the browser console (F12) if something's not working
2. Use the Network tab to see API calls in action
3. TypeScript errors are your friends - they prevent bugs!
4. Comments in the code explain the "why" behind the "what"

Happy coding! üöÄ
